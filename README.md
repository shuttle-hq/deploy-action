# Shuttle Deploy Action

This action automates the deployment of a Rust project to [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/). This action deploys the project to Shuttle, which builds it and hosts it.

Note that you need to have created a project on Shuttle before you can deploy to it. This action will NOT create a new project for you.
You can see the documentation on how to create a project [here](https://docs.shuttle.rs/introduction/quick-start).

Shuttle Secrets are not handled by this action (yet). Add secrets using Secrets.toml with a manual deploy command. Read more about secrets [here](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-secrets).
